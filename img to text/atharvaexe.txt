regulations following were observed:

i. As per provision 5(4)(a) of Nutra regulations 2022. a cross reference to the GMP
table (Appendix 'A') of the FSS (FPS&FA) Regulations, 2011 has been given for
the list of food additives to be used at GMP levels. However, some of the additives
namely- Ammonium acetate, Ammonium lactate, Choline salt and esters,
Cross carmellose sodium, Potassium hydrogen malate, Sodium starch
glycolate and Sucrose oligoesters-Type I and Uf which were present in the
Schedule VE of the previous FSS (Nutraceutical) Regulations, 2016 are not present
in the GMP table (Appendix 'A’) of the FSS (FPS&FA) Regulations, 2011.

ii. Further. as per provision 6(1)(b) of the FSS (Nutra) Regulations, 2022, the proteins
and enzymes specified under Schedule IIT have been inadvertently excluded for use
in Health supplement.
