**GUIDELINES FOR FOOD RECALL**

### Introduction

Food intended for human consumption must be wholesome, unadulterated, uncontaminated, properly labeled, and fit for consumption. Violations of these standards can lead to regulatory action against the Food Business Operator (FBO) under the Food Safety and Standards Act (the Act), rules, and regulations made thereunder.

### Food Recall

Food recalls are a method for removing or correcting marketed food products and their labeling that violate laws administered by the regulatory authority. A recall can be defined as an action to remove food products from the market at any stage of the food chain, including those possessed by consumers, which may pose a threat to public health or violate the Act, or the rules or regulations made thereunder. Recalls protect consumers and are generally more efficient and timely than formal administrative or civil actions, especially when the product has been widely distributed.

Manufacturers and/or distributors should initiate a recall to protect public health from products that present a risk of injury, gross deception, or are otherwise defective. Firms may also initiate a recall following notification of a problem by the Food Authority or a state agency, in response to a formal request by the authority, or as ordered by the authority.

### Purpose of this Guideline

The purpose of this guide is to provide an overview of how to develop a recall plan and how to implement that plan in the event of a recall. It assists in identifying unsafe products that violate the Act, or the rules or regulations made thereunder, and enables the recall of these products from the marketplace.

### Role of the Food Authority

The Food Authority's main role in a recall is to monitor the progress of the recall and assess the adequacy of the actions taken by the FBO. After a recall is completed, the Food Authority ensures that the product is destroyed or suitably improved. If the recall is related to serious defects in the manufacturing process, the concerned authority may review the license of the FBO.

The Food Authority will publicize the recall when it believes the public needs to be alerted about a health hazard or to clarify the situation to alleviate public worries. In cases of public health emergencies, the Food Authority may alert the public before a decision on the recall has been reached, based on the available evidence.

### Role of the Industry

Food Business Operators (FBOs) have the primary responsibility for implementing the recall and ensuring compliance with the recall procedure at its various stages, including follow-up checks to ensure the recall's success and the safety of subsequent batches of the food products.

If an FBO considers or has reason to believe that a food product it has processed, manufactured, distributed, or imported is not in compliance with food safety requirements, it must immediately initiate procedures to recall the food in question from the market and inform the competent authorities. If the product has reached consumers, the FBO must inform them of the reason for the recall and, if necessary, recall the product from consumers.

An FBO must immediately inform the competent authorities if it considers or has reason to believe that a food product it has placed on the market may be unsafe for consumers. The FBO must inform the authorities of the actions taken to prevent risks to the final consumer and must not prevent or discourage any person from cooperating with national law and concerned authorities to prevent, reduce, or eliminate a risk arising from food.

FBOs must collaborate with the concerned authorities on actions taken to avoid or reduce risks posed by a food product they supply or have supplied.

**Food Recall Plan**

All food business operators as prescribed in Regulation 7 of Food Safety and Standards (Food Recall Procedure) Regulations, 2017, must have an up-to-date recall plan as provided in Annex (Model Recall Plan)- I. At the time of a recall, the FBO shall submit their detailed recall plan to the CEO, FSSAI. A brief step-by-step procedure and its description are as follows.

### Steps for Conducting a Recall Plan

**Step 1: Assemble the Recall Management Team**
- Initiate the formation of a recall management team.
- Assign recall duties to each person.
- Ensure all team members are informed of the recall and know their responsibilities.

The team should include people responsible for:
1. Decision making
2. Quality assurance/technical advisory
3. Media communication
4. Complaint investigation
5. Contacting accounts
6. Food Authority contact
7. Legal counsel

The management team document should contain:
- Names and alternate persons
- Business and after-hours phone numbers
- Responsibilities during the recall

**Step 2: Inform the Authority**
- Notify the concerned regulatory authority as soon as an incident is identified that may lead to a recall.
- Update the authority throughout the recall process.

Information to provide:
- Detailed description of the nature of the problem
- Name, brand, size, lot code(s) affected
- Details of complaints received and any reported illnesses
- Distribution of the product (local or national)
- Specific dates of product distribution

**Step 3: Identify All Products to be Recalled**
- Ensure all products needing recall are identified.
- Determine if other codes, brands, sizes of the same product are affected.
- Determine if any other products are affected.

**Step 4: Detain and Segregate Products to be Recalled**
- Ensure all products to be recalled that are under your firm's control are not distributed.
- Determine locations of the recalled products (on-site, at the plant, off-site storage).
- Identify and segregate products to prevent distribution.

**Step 5: Prepare and Distribute the Information of Recall**
- Inform consumers about the recall at the earliest possible moment.
- Use press releases, letters, or paid advertisements to disseminate information.
- Ensure sufficient telephone hotline service to handle inquiries.

Information within the food chain:
- Inform everyone in the food chain, from raw material vendors to suppliers and relevant retailers or trade associations.
- Communicate via written communication, phone, email, fax, or a combination thereof.

The press release, letter, or advertisement should be in the form of a ‘Food Recall Notice’ and contain:
- Name of the FBO recalling the food
- Name of the food, brand name, pack size, batch and code number, date of manufacture, use by date, or best before date
- Contamination or violation in the food or reason for the recall
- "Do not consume" message
- Health warning and action
- Places or outlets where the food is found
- Actions to be taken by the consumer
- Contact number for queries

The FBO must:
- Complete the press release within two hours after being notified of the recall
- Submit a draft of the proposed press release, if required, to the concerned authority for approval
- Arrange for the translation of the press release for the concerned region

**Step 6: Prepare the Distribution List**
- Maintain accurate distribution records to limit the recall to specific accounts that received the recalled product.
- Produce a product and lot code-specific distribution list identifying:
  - Accounts that received the recalled product
  - Account names, addresses, contact names, and telephone numbers
  - Type of account (e.g., manufacturer, distributor, retailer)

**Step 7: Verify the Effectiveness of the Recall**
- Ensure the recall is progressing effectively and submit periodic status reports to the concerned authority.
- Submit periodic recall status reports once a week or as specified by the authority.
- Maintain food distribution records, including suppliers and distributors' names and addresses, date of purchase of raw material, batch code, lot number, and complete traceability from raw material to finished goods.

The FBO must:
- Verify all accounts have stopped distributing and selling the recalled products.
- Verify the recalled products have been returned.

**Step 8: Control the Recalled Products**
- Recover the products to a central site or major recovery sites.
- Store the recovered products in a separate area from other food products.
- Keep accurate records of the amount of recovered product and the batch codes.

The FBO must ensure that recalled products do not re-enter the market by:
- Separating and clearly identifying recalled products
- Reconciling quantities and monitoring returned products
- Recording the recalled products in the Recalled Product Records document

**Step 9: Decide What to Do with the Returned Products**
- Determine if the products can be corrected or reprocessed before release to the market if fit for human consumption, otherwise, they must be destroyed.
- Obtain approval from the competent authority for actions taken on recalled products.

The FBO must:
- Decide on the action for the recalled products (e.g., correction, re-export, destruction)
- Verify if the authority wants to witness/verify the action taken
- Ensure the action has been effective
- Record the action taken for each product in the Recalled Product Records document

**Step 10: Fix the Cause of the Recall**
- Implement controls or revise existing controls to prevent similar problems in the future.
- Take all reasonable steps to prevent similar recalls.
