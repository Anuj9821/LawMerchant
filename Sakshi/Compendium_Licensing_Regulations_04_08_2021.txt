1.10 Regulation: Vehicle Disinfection  
The Vehicles should be thoroughly sprayed with suitable disinfectant before loading the animals.

1.11 Regulation: Flooring Requirements  
A layer of clean sand to cover the floor to a thickness of not less than 6 cm shall be provided. This layer of sand shall be moistened with water during the summer months. During hot months, arrangements shall be made to sprinkle water on the animals at frequent intervals. In winter, a 2-cm layer of clean sand with another 6-cm layer of whole-straw shall be provided.

1.12 Regulation: Animal Handling During Loading/Unloading  
Animals when driven for loading or unloading shall never be struck with a stick. Driving could best be done by a soft-rubber pipe.

1.13 Regulation: Climate Considerations  
If animals are to be transported in extreme cold or hot climates, it is preferable to transport them in covered lorries on the road so that they may not die or get exhausted or suffer from acute respiratory disease. Journeys under such adverse climates shall be minimized.

1.14 Regulation: Consignment Labeling  
Each consignment should bear a label showing the following particulars:
   - Number and kind of the animals loaded
   - Name, address, and telephone number, if any, of the consignor;

4.0 Slaughter

Regulation: Stunning Before Slaughter  
Animals are slaughtered by being first stunned and then exsanguinated (bled out). Stunning can be effected through asphyxiating the animals with carbon dioxide, shooting them with a gun or a captive bolt pistol, or shocking them with electric current. Stunning before slaughter should be mandatory to minimize pain and suffering.

Stunning Methods:

(i) Regulation: Mechanical Stunning  
Mechanical stunning of cattle may be carried out by one of three methods: captive bolt stunning, mushroom head percussive stunning, and pneumatic percussive stunning. For cattle, pneumatic stunning should be preferred and the optimum position is that the center of the stunner should contact the animal at a point of intersection of lines drawn from the medial corners of the eyes and the base of the ears. The best position for pigs is on the midline just above eye level, with the host directed down the line of the spinal cord. The optimum position for sheep and goat is behind the poll, aiming towards the angle of the jaw. If an animal shows signs of regaining consciousness after the initial stun, the animal must be immediately killed by the use of a captive bolt gun.

(ii) Regulation: Electrical Stunning  
Electrical Head Stunners may be preferred for sheep and goat where both electrodes are placed on the head region. Water bath electrical stunning may be used for poultry birds. A low and controlled voltage must be maintained so that the stunning will not damage the heart and brain or cause physical disability and death to the animals. 

(iii) Regulation: Gas Stunning  
Stunning of pigs by exposure to carbon dioxide (CO2) may be preferred. The concentration of CO2 should be 90% by volume but shall not be less than 80% by volume. Ideally, pigs should be exposed for 3 minutes. Sticking should be done immediately after exit from the gas chamber. Over-crowding of animals should be avoided in the gas chamber.

5.0 Precautions for Animal Welfare

General Precautions:

The floor of the slaughter area should not cause slipping or falling of animals.

b. Regulation: Animal Vocalization  
Vocalization is an indicator of animal discomfort and needs to be watched for.

c. Regulation: Use of Electric Pods  
Use of electric pods for moving animals should be discouraged. Movement of animals can be managed by grouping, use of plastic-wrapped sticks, etc.

d. Regulation: Pen Stocking Density  
Pen stocking density should be monitored. All animals should have room to lie down simultaneously. The condition of animals arriving for slaughter should be closely monitored so that injured, diseased animals are not slaughtered.

e. Regulation: Noise Levels  
High-pitch sounds such as whistling and yelling should be avoided to spare distress to animals.

Critical Factors for Animal Welfare:

a. Regulation: Supervision and Training  
Supervision and training of employees.

b. Regulation: Design of Transport and Unloading  
Designing of animal transport carts and unloading bay.

c. Regulation: Construction of Holding Pens  
Proper construction of holding/resting pens, stunning box, maintenance of stunning equipment, restraining systems, gates, and other animal handling equipment.

d. Regulation: Avoiding Distractions  
Avoiding distractions that make animals refuse to move.

e. Regulation: Monitoring Animal Condition  
Monitoring the condition of animals arriving at the plant.

f. Regulation: Equipment Design  
Proper design of equipment in the slaughterhouse.

Pre-Slaughter Handling:

- Pre-slaughter handling of animals should be carefully done to reduce stress.
- Resting of the animals is essential.
- Only animals that are disease-free and in a condition to walk should be brought for slaughter.
- Distractions that impede animal movements such as reflections, air blowing towards animals, and movement or high-pitch noise need to be avoided.
- Herding of animals should not be done through electric prods but with the help of plastic bags or sticks.
- A high standard of training is required for employees to ensure that basic hygiene and safety practices are followed while handling animals.
- Equipment used for slaughter, such as captive bolt stunners, gates, hooks, etc., should be kept

 in good working condition. Cleanliness of floors needs to be ensured. There should be daily checks to ensure the smooth working of equipment and cleanliness of floors.
- The condition of the animals arriving at the plant should be monitored. Animals that are injured or not in a condition to walk should not be slaughtered.
- Inspecting personnel should pay particular attention to these points to ensure reasonable standards of animal welfare.

6.0 Poultry Welfare

Regulation: Welfare Programme  
The conditions under which broilers are housed and the way that they are managed during their growing phase, transportation, and slaughter are set down in several government/industry-endorsed Model Codes of Practice designed to safeguard their welfare.

A model welfare program needs to be developed for pick-up, transport, and broiler/chicken processing sectors. Processing units shall incorporate elements of this welfare audit in their own quality plans and manuals.

Model Program Components:

a. Regulation: Catching  
Poultry intended for the slaughter plant should be clean and in good health. Every reasonable precaution should be taken to minimize injury to poultry. The catcher needs to be trained to this effect.

b. Regulation: Transport  
For transport of poultry, crates shall be in good repair. There shall be no crate/cage damage that would allow injury to poultry or allow crates to accidentally open. Transport crates should not be overfilled, and enough space should be provided to allow all poultry to lie down.

c. Regulation: Holding  
Poultry held in storage sheds should be provided adequate ventilation and climate control such as fans or curtains.

d. Regulation: Stunning  
Stunning equipment should be properly maintained to confirm that poultry are insensible prior to slaughter, and the time between stunning and slaughter should be limited to minimize any likelihood that poultry may regain consciousness prior to slaughter.

Economic Performance and Welfare:

High standards of poultry welfare and high levels of flock performance and economic performance are not incompatibleâ€”quite the contrary, they go hand in hand. It simply makes good economic sense as well as being in the poultry's best interests to ensure that flocks are maintained in an environment in which they are thermally comfortable, protected from injury, fed optimally, and kept healthy. Therefore, all measures described elsewhere to ensure that chickens are kept in conditions that optimize their comfort (in terms of temperature, humidity, air flow, and air quality), in which they are provided with water, shelter, and a high-quality diet that matches their physiological needs, and which optimize their health have just as important an effect in terms of poultry welfare as they do on the overall efficiency of the farming operation.

Poultry Health and Welfare:

When producing chicken meat in a welfare-friendly manner, it is also important that the poultry receive prompt and appropriate medication and treatment to prevent and treat diseases if this should become necessary, and that they do not suffer any unnecessary pain, distress, fear, or physical injury. It is also important that sick or injured poultry that cannot be adequately or successfully treated are culled quickly and in a humane manner so that they do not suffer.

Regulation: Humane Slaughter (Poultry)  
While the chickens are reared specifically for human consumption and they therefore at some stage have to be slaughtered, they should be slaughtered in a humane manner, and all poultry should be stunned (rendered insensible to pain) prior to slaughter. Slaughter equipment at all supply facilities should be properly maintained to confirm that the poultry are slaughtered quickly.

7.0 Ante-Mortem Inspection

1. Regulation: Resting Before Slaughter  
All animals shall be rested before slaughter and shall be subjected to ante-mortem examination and inspection well in advance of the time of slaughter.

2. Regulation: Removal from Slaughter Hall  
No animal which has been received into a slaughter hall for the purpose of being slaughtered shall be removed from the slaughter hall before being slaughtered except with the written consent of the Qualified Veterinary Doctor. An animal which, on inspection, is found to be not fit for slaughter shall be marked as "suspect" and kept separately. Each such animal shall be marked as "suspect" only by or under the personal supervision of the Qualified Veterinary Doctor, and the marking shall not be removed or obliterated except by the Qualified Veterinary Doctor himself.

3. Regulation: Condemned Animals  
An animal showing signs of any disease at the time of ante-mortem inspection that would cause its carcass being ultimately condemned on post-mortem shall be marked as "condemned" and rejected.

4. Regulation: Suspect Animals  
An animal declared as "suspect" on ante-mortem inspection but which does not plainly show any disease or condition that would cause its entire carcass to be condemned shall maintain its identity as "suspect" until its carcass and all organs are finally inspected by the Qualified Veterinary Doctor.

5. Regulation: Febrile Condition  
No animal in a febrile condition shall be permitted for slaughter. No suspect animal shall be slaughtered until all other animals intended for slaughter on the same day have been slaughtered. All animals which, on ante-mortem inspection, show symptoms of railroad sickness, parturient paresis, rabies, tetanus, or any other communicable diseases shall be marked as "condemned" and disposed of in accordance with the provisions contained in sub-paragraph (8) below.

6. Regulation: Dying Condition  
Animals presented for slaughter and found in a dying condition on the premises of a factory due to recent disease shall be marked as "condemned" and disposed of as provided for "condemned" animals.

7. Regulation: Special Pen for Observation  
Every animal which, upon examination, is found to show symptoms of or is suspected of being diseased or animals declared as "suspect" shall at once be removed for treatment to such special pen and kept there for observation for such period as may be considered necessary to ascertain whether the animal is diseased or not.
