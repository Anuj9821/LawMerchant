   - **Substitute Ingredients**: Ingredients are carefully selected to minimize the risk of allergic reactions while still providing essential nutrients for infant growth and development.

2. **Regulation: Labeling**:
   - **Allergy Warning**: Products are labeled as "HYPOALLERGENIC FORMULA" to indicate their suitability for infants with cow's milk protein allergy.
   - **Medical Consultation**: Warnings advise consumers to consult with healthcare professionals before use, especially if their infant has known or suspected allergies, to ensure the product is appropriate for their needs.

### Foods for Infants with Inborn Errors of Metabolism (IEM):
1. **Regulation: Description**:
   - **Custom Formulation**: Products are formulated to meet the specific nutritional needs of infants with inborn errors of metabolism, taking into account their unique metabolic conditions and dietary restrictions.
   - **Specialized Processing**: Ingredients undergo specialized processing to ensure that they are safe and suitable for infants with metabolic disorders, with particular attention to protein, carbohydrate, and fat sources.

2. **Regulation: Composition**:
   - **Nutrient Modification**: Nutrient levels are adjusted to accommodate the metabolic requirements of infants with specific disorders, such as phenylketonuria (PKU) or maple syrup urine disease (MSUD).
   - **Amino Acid Formulas**: Some products may contain amino acid-based formulas to provide essential amino acids while avoiding substances that the infant's body cannot metabolize properly.
